# MyGarage App

An app which pictures some parking lots where you can park cars. These cars could easily created with the car identification numbers hsn/tsn. Also a car could created manually by filling out the technical car data. If for a specific car the TÃœV or other data is entered, the app helps to remember them. Oil, timing belt, air conditioning and brakes data can be stored to determine at what interval they need to be changed to keep the car for a long time.
